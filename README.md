# Michael Wright Very Technical Test

Note that there are some warnings with react as a new version has just been released, but i've kept the project on version 17.

## Dependencies

### Redux

I have used Redux on this project as a demonstration of being able to use it. The main reason i used it was to bring a more reactive cart section to the page.

### React Testing Library

Tests have been written in React testing library, test files are in their corresponding folders.

### ESLint

Eslint has been installed onto this project for style handling and consistency. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all required dependencies to start the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
